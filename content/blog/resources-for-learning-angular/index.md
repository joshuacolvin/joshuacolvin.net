Learning a new framework can be a daunting task. One thing that makes this task even more difficult is deciding which resources are worth your time. In an attempt to save others from the pain I experienced learning Angular, here are the resources I found to be the most helpful.

## [Angular.io ](https://angular.io/)

The Angular team, and community, put a lot of effort into the [documentation](https://angular.io/docs) so this is a great place to start. I recommend going through the [QuickStart](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) and [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial) tutorial. These will give you a great overview of the different pieces that make up an Angular application and how they fit together. While you’re on the Angular site check out the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide). This opinionated style guide will answer everything from “How do I structure my application” to “What naming conventions should I follow”. Following the style guide recommendations will keep your learning efforts from getting derailed by decision fatigue.

## [Ultimate Angular ](https://ultimatecourses.com/angular)

If you want to become an Angular expert there is no better way than taking Todd Motto’s [Angular Fundamentals](https://ultimatecourses.com/angular/fundamentals) and [Angular Pro](https://ultimatecourses.com/angular/pro) courses. Todd’s courses are top notch and cover every conceivable aspect of Angular in depth. These courses are not the cheapest ($119 each if purchased separately, or $179 for both), but they are well worth the investment.

## [Todd Motto’s Blog ](https://toddmotto.com/)

Not only does Todd offer some of the best Angular courses out there, he also shares a lot of free Angular content on his blog. Each article is a deep dive into a different aspect of Angular. Topics range from [Creating your first Angular 2+ Component](https://toddmotto.com/creating-your-first-angular-2-component) to [Lazy Loading: code splitting NgModules with Webpack](https://toddmotto.com/lazy-loading-angular-code-splitting-webpack).

## [Pluralsight’s Angular Learning Path ](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/angular)

Pluralsight offers many courses on Angular and has put together a learning path to help you gain a mastery of the framework. The learning path consists of seven courses covering the basics, routing, forms, the CLI, and best practices. Deborah Kurata’s [Angular Getting Started](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-2-getting-started-update) will serve as a great introduction to Angular if you’re just getting started.

## [Frontend Masters Building Awesome Web Apps with Angular 2 ](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-apps-angular-2/)

This ten hour Frontend Masters workshop taught by Lukas Rubbelke is a great way to get up to speed quickly. You will get an excellent overview of Angular and learn how all the pieces fit together. Coding challenges throughout the workshop will aide in testing your understanding.

## [Thoughtram Blog ](https://blog.thoughtram.io/categories/angular-2/)

Another excellent blog in the same vain as Todd Motto’s. The team at Thoughtram write in depth articles about all things Angular. Their posts on [change detection](https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/02/22/angular-2-change-detection-explained.html) and [zones](https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/01/22/understanding-zones.html) are a must read for anyone who wants to fully understand the framework.
